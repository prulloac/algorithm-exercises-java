## Usage

- Write your code in the folder that matches the problem's name and folder hierarchy.
- Filename should be the problem's name in UpperCamelCase.
- Use the `main` method to test your code.
- Use records to represent data structures for inputs and outputs.
- Use the `assert` statement to test your code.
- Use the `System.out.println` statement to debug your code.
- Write your solution in the `Solution` class.
- Execute the java file to test your solution.

```bash
java --source 21 --enable-preview path/to/your/Solution.java
```

> **Note**: There is a SolutionTemplate.java file in the root folder that you can use as a starting point.

> **Note**: This is a work in progress. I will be adding more exercises and solutions as I go.
